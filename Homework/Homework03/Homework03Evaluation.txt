======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

I like the way you output what you are doing with the tests in the
oddEvenSortApp.  Try to remember that the convention is to use
an upper case letter at the start of all class names and class files.
This is a convention for many languages, not just Java.  Also, it is
the convention to name your java file with the IDENTICAL name that is
CONTAINED inside the file.  You have "oddEvenSortApp.java" that has
the class "ArrayBub" as its main class.  You might get away with it
sometimes, but not always, so be careful.  Following the convention
is the safest bet.

The Simon game works fine!  I was able to cheat a bit, though, by
expanding my screen to maximum height so I could see multiple letters
at the same time.  One of the problems with TUI's!!

Huffman coding!! whoa....  Works great!  Nice work.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 13 out of 13 which is 100% which is an A-plus

you got 20 out of 13 which is 153.85% which is still an A-plus
