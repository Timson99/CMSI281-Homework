Homework04 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Tim's repo.

Note that I got a compile error when I tried to compile all
the files at once with 'javac *.java', but they all DO compile
individually just fine.  This means, though that you have to
re-compile them when you are ready to run them, because there
are two duplicate classes that cover each other up.

Problem with the HashTableApp -- it works, but I don't see any
STRINGS in the table.  However, when I search for strings and
delete strings, they are found and deleted properly.  Hmmm...
